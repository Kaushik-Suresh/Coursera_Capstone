Ecco restaurant “Italian saloon” that has been on Chambers for more than 35 years and has been featured in a dozen movies,
TV shows and even Nelson DeMille’s novels.The restaurant was closed and people started quoting “Ecco! it is certainly the end of an era”

But the management has risen and wants to re-establish their stand in the food business starting from the upcoming Christmas 2021.
Since they have been away for a long time from the New York food business, they wanted to make a statement that they are back in Business. 

Ecco restaurant is planning on giving huge offers of 50% to all their food orders above 20$ from Dec 14,2021 to Dec 26,2021.
The offers are given to the general public in poster pamphlets, which has the offer attached to it.
The customers have to bring in the pamphlets to avail the offers.
The Ecco management wants a data driven approach on sharing these pamphlet posters in the neighbourhood places near to the establishment,
which are most popular among the general public.

The allotted marketing budget for their bold strategy is 10000$, with 2$/poster we have around 5000 pamphlets posters which needs to be distributed among the public.

The Ecco management has approached me to find a solution to identify those popular
places to distribute the pamphlets to have a wider reach and knowledge about their offers to the general public.
