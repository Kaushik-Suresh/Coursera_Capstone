DATA REQUIREMENT


As The Ecco restaurant management has approached me to find a solution to identify the popular places near their establishment to distribute the pamphlets,
which consists of 50% offers on all orders above 20$.

As their Data scientist, I am entitled to find an efficient approach to identify the popular places near the Ecco restaurant to make sure their 
marketing startegy turns out profitable and the pamplet posters reach to a wider general public.

Data:
 - I will be using the FourSquareAPI to collect the information of the popular places near the Ecco restaurant given it's latitude and longitude co-ordinates
 - Ratings of these popular places will also be extracted using the venue_ids extracted earlier to make 
   sure that we distribute the pamplet posters in the right location
